#A branch must meet all the following criteria to be deemed abandoned and safe to delete:
#
#  Must NOT be the default branch (eg master or main, depending on your repository settings)
#  Must NOT be a protected branch
#  Must NOT have any open pull requests
#  Must NOT be the base of an open pull request of another branch. The base of a pull request is the branch you told GitHub you want to merge your pull request into.
#  Must NOT be in an optional list of branches to ignore
#  Must be older than a given amount of days
