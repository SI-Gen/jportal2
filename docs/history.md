## History
### JPortal
JPortal was originally developed in the early 1990's by Vincent Risi (https://github.com/VincentRisi) as a standardised way to generate a Data Access Layer (DAL) for multiple databases and target languages. SI Files allow the definition of a SQL table with columns, as well as SQL Queries to be run against the table. It then allows the generation of a DAL in a number of languages. Being developed in the 90's, the first languages that were supported, were Java, C++, C and Visual Basic. Original database support was for Oracle.

Over the years the tool has grown into a suite of tools to include generators DAL's, RPC client and server generators and for a number of languages including C# and Python, and database support for Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, DB2 and SQLite.


### JPortal2

The original JPortal grew organically, and while over the years the capabilities have expanded, lots of it was not envisioned originally. As a result, some of the code has become difficult to maintain. JPortal2 is an attempt to clean up the code bit-by-bit, and also start adding unittests and other features that are required in modern libraries.

### Original Code
The original JPortal code can be found at https://github.com/VincentRisi. An updated version with some bug-fixes can be found at https://github.com/dieterrosch. However, this repo (https://github.com/SI-Gen) is the only actively maintained repository.
