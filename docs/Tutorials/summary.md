You have now completed the JPortal2 tutorial. Well done!

Let's recap what we covered in this tutorial:  
1. You learnt how to create a simple table, and generate basic CRUD queries like `Insert`, `Update`, `SelectOne` and 
`DeleteOne`. You also learnt how to insert test data into your database.  
2. You learnt how to generate Postgres DDL, using the built-in Postres DDL generator.  
3. You learnt how to generate Python code, using the SQLAlchmemy template generator.  
4. Next you learnt how to create foreign keys, and how to write a more complex select query using `SelectBy`.  
5. Lastly you learnt how to write your own custom queries, and also how to use dynamic SQL to do things that you
can't otherwise do using parameterised SQL.  

We hope you enjoyed working through this tutorial, and you see the power that is available to you when you use it.
Here's hoping you keep using it on your projects!
